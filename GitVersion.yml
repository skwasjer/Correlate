# If your package version contains one of the following, they will not be visible from the older clients
# (NuGet clients before 4.3.0 or Visual Studio before 2017 version 15.3):
# The pre-release label is dot-separated, e.g. 1.0.0-alpha.1
# The version has build-metadata, e.g. 1.0.0+githash We recommend you consider this to be a beta-feature until a significant majority of our users are on these latest clients that understand Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.
